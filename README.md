# FAU Scholarship Application

## Development

### Dependencies
Make sure you have at least
 - PHP 7.1
 - Node.js 8.11+

Install @vue/cli if you don't already have it 

`npm i -g @vue/cli`

In the project root, install remaining dependencies with

```
npm i
php composer.phar
```

### Local Server
The best way to set things up locally is by running

`npm run watch`

and

`php composer.phar start`

In two different CLI windows. 

You will still need to set up or configure a database in src/config.json
