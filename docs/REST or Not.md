Server Monolith vs Client/Server RESTful API
=============================================

# Server Monolith
## Pros
- Simplicity
- Don't have to worry about data synchronization
- Easier for one person to manage and Maintain
- Can still use React/Vue
- Easier to focus on What Needs To Happen instead of getting distracted by ALL POSSIBILITIES

## Cons
- Not as big of a learning opportunity

# Client/Server API
## Pros
- Scales better
- Better reflects some aspects of modern development

## Cons
- Pointless
- Extra work for minimal gain
- Harder to maintain

# Something in between
Get the scaling of the API/Rest thing. Use SlimPHP to also deliver the webpages instead of mucking around with frontend javascript clients.
